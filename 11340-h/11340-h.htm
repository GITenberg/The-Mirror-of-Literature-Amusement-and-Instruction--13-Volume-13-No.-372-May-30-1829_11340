    </div>
    <p>
      We do not wish to compete with the "List of all the running
      horse-es, with the names, weights, and colours of the
      riders," although the proximity of our publication day to the
      commencement of Epsom Races (June 2), has induced us to
      select the above subject for an illustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The erection of the New Race Stand is the work of a company,
      entitled the "Epsom Grand Stand Association"&mdash;the
      capital &pound;20,000, in 1,000 shares of &pound;20 each. The
      speculation is patronized by the Stewards of the Jockey Club,
      and among the trustees is one of the county members, C.N.
      Pallmer, Esq. The building is now roofed in, and temporary
      accommodation will be provided for visitors at the ensuing
      Spring Races. It is after the model of the Stand at
      Doncaster, but is much larger, and will accommodate from 4 to
      5,000 persons. The style of the architecture is Grecian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building is 156 feet in width, including the Terrace, and
      60 feet in depth, having a portico the width, returning on
      each side, which is connected with a spacious terrace, raised
      ten feet above the level of the ground, and a magnificent
      flight of steps in the centre. The columns of the portico are
      of the Doric order, supporting a balcony, or gallery, which
      is to be covered by a verandah, erected on small ornamental
      iron pillars, placed over those below. The upper part of the
      Stand is to have a balustrade the whole width of the front.
      With reference to the interior arrangements, there are four
      large and well-proportioned rooms for refreshments, &amp;c.;
      a spacious hall, leading through a screen of Doric columns to
      a large and elegant staircase of stone, and on each side of
      the staircase are retiring rooms of convenience for
      gentlemen. The entrance to this floor is from the
      abovementioned terrace and portico in front; and also, at the
      back, by an entrance which forms a direct communication
      through the building. The first floor consists of a splendid
      room, 108 feet in length, and 34 in width, divided into three
      compartments by ornamental columns
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page354" name="page354"></a>[pg
      354]</span> and pilasters, supporting a richly paneled
      ceiling, and having a direct communication with the balcony,
      or gallery; and on each side of the staircase there are
      retiring rooms for the ladies, with the same arrangements as
      those below for the gentlemen. The roof will contain about
      2,000 persons standing; affording, at the same time, an
      opportunity for every one to see the whole of the race (Derby
      Course) which at one time was considered doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The architect is Mr. W. Trendall; and the builder Mr.
      Chadwick.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a neat plan from a survey by Mr. Mogg, the "Stand" is
      about ten poles from the Winning Post. It must have a most
      commanding view of the surrounding country--but, anon, "may
      we be there to see."

    <h3>
      HISTORY OF COALS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Coals are found in several parts of the continent of Europe,
      but the principal mines are in this country. They have been
      discovered and wrought in Newfoundland, Cape Breton, Canada,
      and in some of the provinces of New England. China abounds in
      them, and they are well known in Tartary, and in the Island
      of Madagascar.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find (says Brand) express mention of coals, used as a fuel
      by artificers about 2,000 years ago, in the writings of
      Theophrastus, the scholar of Aristotle, who, in his book on
      Stones, gives the substance; though some writers have not
      scrupled to affirm, that coal was unknown to the Ancient
      Britons, yet others have adduced proofs to the contrary,
      which seem, to carry along with them little less than
      conviction. The first charter for the license of digging
      coals, was granted by King Henry III. in the year 1239; it
      was there denominated sea coal; and, in 1281, Newcastle was
      famous for its great trade in this article; but in 1306, the
      use of sea coal was prohibited at London, by proclamation.
      Brewers, dyers, and other artificers, who had occasion for
      great fires, had found their account in substituting our
      fossil for dry wood and charcoal; but so general was the
      prejudice against it at that time, that the nobles and
      commons assembled in parliament, complained against the use
      thereof as a public nuisance, which was thought to corrupt
      the air with its smoke and stink. Shortly after this, it was
      the common fuel at the King's palace in London; and, in 1325,
      a trade was opened between France and England, in which corn
      was imported, and coal exported. Stowe in his "Annals" says,
      "within thirty years last the nice dames of London would not
      come into any house or roome where sea coales were burned;
      nor willingly eat of the meat that was either sod or roasted
      with sea coal fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tinmouth Priory had a colliery at Elwick, which in 1330 was
      let at the yearly rent of five pounds; in 1530 it was let for
      twenty pounds a year, on condition that not more than twenty
      chaldron should be drawn in a day; and eight years after, at
      fifty pounds a year, without restriction on the quantity to
      be wrought. In Richard the Second's time, Newcastle coals
      were sold at Whitby, at three shillings and four-pence per
      chaldron; and in the time of Henry VIII. their price was
      twelvepence a chaldron in Newcastle; in London about four
      shillings, and in France they sold for thirteen nobles per
      chaldron. Queen Elizabeth obtained a lease of the manors and
      coal mines of Gateshead and Whickham, which she soon
      transferred to the Earl of Leicester. He assigned it to his
      secretary, Sutton, the founder of the Charter-house, who also
      made assignment of it to Sir W. Riddell and others, for the
      use of the Mayor and Burgesses of Newcastle. Duties were laid
      upon this article to assist in building St. Paul's Church,
      and fifty parish churches in London after the great fire; and
      in 1677, Charles II. granted to his natural son, Charles
      Lenox, Duke of Richmond, and his heirs, a duty of one
      shilling a chaldron on coals, which continued in his family
      till it was purchased by government in 1800. The collieries
      in the vicinity of Newcastle are perhaps the most valuable
      and extensive in Europe, and afford nearly the whole supply
      of the metropolis, and of those counties on the eastern coast
      deficient in coal strata; thus&mdash;

      ALEHOUSE SIGNS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of your correspondents have puzzled themselves in seeking
      the origin of the old Cat and Fiddle sign. The one has been
      led away by a love of etymology&mdash;the other would string
      the fiddle at the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page355"
      name="page355"></a>[pg 355]</span> expense of poor puss's
      viscera. Now laying aside conjecture and the subtleties of
      language, suppose we consult plain matter of fact? It is then
      generally allowed that the tones of a flute resemble the
      <i>human voice</i>: those of a clarionet, the notes of a
      <i>goose</i>: and, all the world knows that a well-played
      violin (especially in the practice of gliding) yields sounds
      so inseparable from the <i>strains of a cat</i>, as not to be
      distinguished by the mere amateur of musical science.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conformity, therefore, with this last truth, the small
      fiddles which Dancing-masters carry in their pockets, are at
      this day called <i>kits</i>. But our etymologist will readily
      perceive this to be a mere abbreviation, and that they must
      originally have been known as <i>kittens</i>.

      ANACHRONISMS RESPECTING DR. JOHNSON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)

    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">

          "I am corrected, sir; but hear me speak&mdash;
        </p>
        <p>
          When admiration glows with such a fire
        </p>

          As to o'ertop the memory, error then
        </p>
        <p>
          May merit mercy."&mdash;<i>Old Play</i>.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In justice to myself and the readers of the MIRROR, I must be
      allowed to offer a few apologetic remarks on the almost
      unpardonable anachronisms which I so inadvertently suffered
      to occur in my communication on the subject of Dr. Johnson's
      Residence in Bolt Court. But when I state that the
      chronological metathesis occurred entirely in consequence of
      my referring to that most treacherous portion of human
      intellect, the memory; and that it is upwards of seven years
      since I read "Boswell's Life of Johnson," or "Johnson's
      Poets," it may be some mitigation of the censure I so justly
      deserve. Yet I may be suffered to suggest to your
      correspondent, who has so kindly corrected me, that my paper
      was more in the suppository style than he seems to have
      imagined; and that I did not assert that Boswell, Savage, and
      Johnson, met at the latter's "house in Bolt Court, and
      discussed subjects of polite literature." The expression used
      is, "We can <i>imagine</i>," &amp;c. constituting a creation
      of the fancy rather than a positive portraiture. Certain it
      is that Johnson's dwelling was in the neighbourhood of Temple
      Bar at the time of the nocturnal perambulation alluded to;
      and that it was Savage (to whom he was so unaccountably
      attached, in spite of the "bastard's" frailties) who enticed
      the doctor from his bed to a midnight ramble. My primary
      mistake consists in transposing the date of the doctor's
      residence in Bolt Court, and introducing Savage at the era of
      Boswell's acquaintance with Johnson; whereas the wayward poet
      finished his miserable existence in a prison, at Bristol, 21
      years prior to that event. Here I may be allowed a remark or
      two on the animadversion which has been heaped on Johnson for
      that beautiful piece of biography, "The Life of Richard
      Savage." It has hitherto been somewhat of a mystery that the
      stern critic whose strictures so severely exposed the
      minutest derelictions of genius in all other instances,
      should have adopted "the melting mood" in detailing the life
      of such a man as Savage; for, much as we may admire the
      concentrated smiles and tears of his two poems, "The
      Bastard," and "The Wanderer," pitying the fortunes and
      miseries of the author, yet his ungovernable temper and
      depraved propensities, which led to his embruing his hands in
      blood, his ingratitude to his patrons and benefactors, (but
      chiefly to Pope,) and his degraded misemployment of talents
      which might have raised him to the capital of the proud
      column of intellect of that day,&mdash;all conduce to petrify
      the tear of mingled mercy and compassion, which the
      misfortunes of such a being might otherwise demand.
      Nevertheless, as was lately observed by a respectable
      journal, "there must have been <i>something</i> good about
      him, or Samuel Johnson would not have loved him."

      &mdash;&mdash;He was but a poor undergraduate; not, indeed,
      one of lowest grade, but still too much lacking pecuniary
      supplies to render him an "eligible match." Julia, too,
      though pretty, was portionless; and the world, which always
      kindly interests itself in such affairs, said, they had no
      business whatever to become attached to each other; but then,
      such attachments and the world, never did, and never will
      agree; and <i>I</i>, from fatal experience, assert that what
      people impertinently call "falling in love," is a thing that
      <i>cannot</i> be helped; <i>I</i>, at least, never could help
      it. The regard of Millington and Julia was of a very peculiar
      nature; it was a morsel of platonism, which is rather too
      curious to pass unrecorded; for as far as I have been able,
      upon the most minute investigation to ascertain, they never
      spoke to each other during the period of their tender
      acquaintance. No; they were not dumb, but lacking a mutual
      friend to give them an introduction; their regard for decorum
      and etiquette was too great to permit them to speak otherwise
      than with their eyes. Millington had kept three terms, when I
      arrived at &mdash;&mdash; College, a shy and gawky freshman;
      we had been previously acquainted, and he, pitying perhaps my
      youth and inexperience, patronized his playmate, and I became
      his chum. For some time I was at a loss to account for sundry
      fluctuations in Henry's disposition and manners. He shunned
      society and would neither accept invitations to wine and
      supper parties in other men's rooms, nor give such in his
      own; nevertheless his person seemed to have become an object
      of the tenderest regard; never was he so contented as when
      rambling through the streets and walks, without his gown, in
      a new and well cut suit; whilst in order eternally to display
      his figure to the best advantage, he was content to endure as
      heavy an infliction of fines and impositions, as the heads of
      his college could lay upon his shoulders. He was ruined for a
      reading-man. About this period he also had a perfect mania
      for flowers; observing which, and fancying I might gratify my
      friend by such a mark of attention, I one day went to his
      rooms with a large bouquet in either hand. He was not at
      home; but having carelessly enough forgotten to lock his
      door, I commenced, <i>con amore</i>, (anticipating the
      agreeable surprise which I should afford him) to fill his
      vases with fresh, bright, and delicious summer flowers, in
      lieu of the very mummies of their race by which they were
      occupied. My work was in progress when Millington returned,
      but, oh! good heavens! the rage, the profane, diabolical,
      incomprehensible rage into which he burst! I shall never
      forget. Away went my beautiful, my fragrant flowers, into the
      court, and seizing upon the remnant of the mummies, as yet
      untouched by my sacrilegious fingers, he tossed them into a
      drawer, double locked it, and ordered me out of the room.
      Dreading a kick, I was off at his word; but had not proceeded
      half way down stairs, when a hand from the rear, roughly
      grasped mine, and a voice, in a wild and hurried manner,
      asked pardon for "intemperance." I should have called it
      madness. We were again firm allies; but I resolved to fathom,
      if possible, the mystery of the flowers. I now observed, with
      surprise, that Millington never quitted his rooms without a
      flower in his hand, or <i>boutonni&egrave;re</i>; which
      flower, upon his return, appeared to have been either lost,
      or metamorphosed into, sometimes, one of another description;
      sometimes into a nosegay. Very strange indeed, thought I; and
      began to have my suspicions that in all this might be traced
      "fair woman's visitings." Yes, Millington must decidedly have
      fallen in love. He was never in chapel, never in hall, never
      in college, never at lectures, and never at parties; he was
      in love, that was certain; but with whom? He knew none of the
      resident gentry of &mdash;&mdash;, and he was far too proud
      to involve himself in "an affair" with a girl of inferior
      rank. Many men did so; but Millington despised them for it.
      Accidentally I discovered that he adored Julia, the young,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page357" name="page357"></a>[pg
      357]</span> sweet daughter of an undoubted gentleman, who was
      not yet "come out." She was a lively, pretty brunette, with
      brownest curling hair, only fifteen; and to this day, I
      believe, knows not the name of her lover. From an attic
      window of a five storied house, this fond and beautiful girl
      contrived, sometimes, to shower upon the head of her devoted
      admirer sweet flowers, and sometimes this paragon of pairs
      meeting each other in the walks, silently effected an
      interchange of the buds and blossoms, with which they always
      took care to be provided. Several weeks passed thus, Henry
      and Julia seeing each other every day; but long vacation
      would arrive; and on the evening preceding his departure from
      &mdash;&mdash;, the lovelorn student, twisting round the stem
      of a spicy carnation, a leaf which he had torn from his
      pocket book, thus conveyed, with his farewell to Julia, an
      intimation that he designed upon his return to college next
      term, to effect an introduction to her family. Julia's
      delight may easily be conceived. I remained in college for
      the vacation to read, and had shortly the pleasure of
      informing Millington that I should be able, upon his return,
      to afford him the introduction which he had so much at heart,
      having made the acquaintance of Julia and her family. Two
      months elapsed ere Millington deigned to notice my letter.
      His answer to it was expressed in these terms:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Freddy&mdash;I'm married to a proper vixen, I fancy; but to
      twenty thousand pounds. Ay, my boy, there it is&mdash;no
      doing in this world without the needful, and I'm not the ass
      to fight shy of such a windfall. As for Julia, hang her. By
      Jove, what an escape&mdash;wasn't it? Name her never again,
      and should she cry for me, give her a sugar plum&mdash;a
      kiss&mdash;a gingerbread husband, or yourself, as you please.
      I am not so fond of milk and water, and bread and butter, I
      can assure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever truly yours,<br />
      Henry Owen Millington.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S. Capital shooting hereabout&mdash;can't you slip over for
      a few days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Julia! I certainly am not clear that I shall not marry
      her myself; but as for that scoundrel Millington, he had
      better take care how he comes in my way&mdash;that's all.

      WHITSUN ALE.

      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Coteswold, Gloucester, is a customary meeting at
      Whitsuntide, vulgarly called an <i>Ale</i>, or <i>Whitsun
      Ale</i>, resorted to by numbers of young people. Two persons
      are chosen previous to the meeting, to be Lord and Lady of
      the Ale or Yule, who dress as suitably as they can to those
      characters; a large barn, or other building is fitted up with
      seats, &amp;c. for the lord's hall. Here they assemble to
      dance and regale in the best manner their circumstances and
      the place will afford; each man treats his sweetheart with a
      ribbon or favour. The lord and lady attended by the steward,
      sword, purse, and mace-bearer, with their several badges of
      office, honour the hall with their presence; they have
      likewise, in their suit, a page, or train-bearer, and a
      jester, dressed in a parti-coloured jacket. The lord's music,
      consisting of a tabor and pipe, is employed to conduct the
      dance. Companies of morrice-dancers, attended by the jester
      and tabor and pipe, go about the country on Monday and
      Tuesday in Whitsun week, and collect sums towards defraying
      the expenses of the Yule. All the figures of the lord,
      &amp;c. of the Yule, handsomely represented in basso-relievo,
      stand in the north wall of the nave of Cirencester Church,
      which vouches for the antiquity of the custom; and, on many
      of these occasions, they erect a may-pole, which denotes its
      rise in Druidism. The mace is made of silk, finely plaited
      with ribbons on the top, and filled with spices and perfumes
      for such of the company to smell to as desire it.

      ANCIENT FUNERAL RITES AMONG THE GREEKS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead were ever held sacred and inviolable even amongst
      the most barbarous nations; to defraud them of any due
      respect was a greater and more unpardonable sacrilege than to
      spoil the temples of the gods; their memories were preserved
      with a religious care and reverence, and all their remains
      honoured with worship and adoration; hatred and envy
      themselves were put to silence, for it was thought a sign of
      a cruel and inhuman disposition to speak evil of the dead,
      and prosecute revenge beyond the grave. The ancient Greeks
      were strongly persuaded that their souls could not be
      admitted into the Elysian fields till their bodies were
      committed to the earth; therefore the honours (says Potter)
      paid to the dead were the greatest and most necessary; for
      these were looked upon as a debt so sacred, that such as
      neglected to discharge it were thought accursed. Those who
      died in foreign countries had usually their ashes
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page358" name="page358"></a>[pg
      358]</span> brought home and interred in the sepulchres of
      their ancestors, or at least in some part of their native
      country; it being thought that the same mother which gave
      them life and birth, was only fit to receive their remains,
      and afford them a peaceful habitation after death. Whence
      ancient authors afford as innumerable instances of bodies
      conveyed, sometimes by the command of oracles, sometimes by
      the good-will of their friends, from foreign countries to the
      sepulchres of their fathers, and with great solemnity
      deposited there. Thus, Theseus was removed from Scyros to
      Athens, Orestes from Tegea, &amp;c. Nor was this pious care
      limited to persons of free condition, but slaves also had
      some share therein; for we find (says Potter) the Athenian
      lawgiver commanding the magistrates, called <i>Demarchi</i>,
      under a severe penalty, to solemnize the funerals, not so
      much of citizens, whose friends seldom failed of paying the
      last honours, as of slaves, who frequently were destitute of
      decent burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who wasted their patrimony, forfeited their right of
      being buried in the sepulchres of their fathers. As soon as
      any person had expired, they closed his eyes. Augustus
      Caesar, upon the approach of his death, called for a
      looking-glass, and caused his hair to be combed, and his
      fallen cheeks decently composed. All the offices about the
      dead were performed by their nearest relations; nor could a
      greater misfortune befal any person than to want these
      respects. When dying, their friends and relations came close
      to the bed where they lay, to bid them farewell, and catch
      their dying words, which they never repeated without
      reverence. The want of opportunity to pay this compliment to
      Hector, furnishes Andromache with matter of lamentation,
      which is related in the Iliad. They kissed and embraced the
      dying person, so taking their last farewell; and endeavoured
      likewise to receive in their mouth his last breath, as
      fancying his soul to expire with it, and enter into their
      bodies. When any person died in debt at Athens, the laws of
      that city gave leave to creditors to seize the dead body, and
      deprive it of burial till payment was made; whence the corpse
      of Miltiades, who died in prison, being like to want the
      honour of burial, his son Cimon had no other means to release
      it, but by taking upon himself his father's debts and
      fetters. Sometime before interment, a piece of money was put
      into the corpse's mouth, which was thought to be Charon's
      fare for wafting the departed soul over the infernal river.

      The Manor of Broughton Lindsay, in Lincolnshire, is held

      annually, upon Palm Sunday, the deputy of the Lord of the
      Manor of Broughton, attends the church at Caistor, with a new
      cart whip in his hand, which he cracks thrice in the church
      porch; and passes with it on his shoulder up the nave into
      the chancel, and seats himself in the pew of the lord of the
      manor, where he remains until the officiating minister is
      about to read the second lesson; he then proceeds with his
      whip, to the lash of which he has in the meantime affixed a
      purse, which ought to contain thirty silver pennies (instead
      of which a single half crown is substituted,) and kneeling
      down before the reading desk, he holds the purse, suspended
      over the minister's head, all the time he is reading the
      lesson. After this he returns to his seat. When divine
      service is over, he leaves the whip and purse at the manor
      house.

      MEXICO, OR NEW SPAIN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The name of New Spain was at first given only to Yucatan by
      Grijalva and his followers; but Cortez extended it to the
      whole empire of Montezuma, which is described by the earliest
      writers to have reached from Panama to New California. This,
      however, appears, from more recent researches, on the
      accuracy of which Humboldt relies with reason, to have been
      larger than the reality justified; and the whole of
      Tenochtitlan may be said to have been contained in the
      present states of Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico, and
      Valadolid. In addition to the name given by Cortez, that of
      the capital was extended to the whole kingdom of New Spain;
      and since the revolution and the establishment of
      independence, the several provinces form separate and
      independent states, confederating together and constituting
      the nineteen United States of Mexico; viz. Chiapa, Chihuahua,
      Cohahuila and Texas, Durango, Guanaxuato, Mexico, Michoachan,
      New Leon, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, Sonora
      and Cinaloa, Tabasco, Tamaulipas, Vera Cruz, Xalisco, Yucatan
      and Zacatecas. Old and New California, Colima, New Mexico,
      and Tlascala, though forming members of the federation,
      declined having state governments, on account of the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page359" name="page359"></a>[pg
      359]</span> expense, and are designated territories. The
      whole republic, according to Humboldt, occupies a space of
      75,830 square leagues, of twenty to an equinoxial degree; on
      which there are to be found every inequality of surface, and
      every variety of soil and climate, the two last of which are
      dependent in most cases on the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      The republic of Mexico, taken on the grand scale, may be
      considered as a succession of small mountain-plains at
      different heights, separated by mountains, and increasing in
      magnitude as the coast recedes on both the eastern and
      western sides, until the great centre plain be reached,
      which, though much broken by mountain ridges, tends to the
      north, maintaining nearly an equal elevation. The snow-capped
      mountains of Orizava, and the volcanos of Puebla and Toluca,
      are among the most splendid objects in the world. The
      Mexicans divide the regions of their country into <i>Tierras
      calientes, Tierras templadas</i>, and <i>Tierras frias</i>,
      according to the climate. Throughout the whole country there
      is a lamentable want of water, and of navigable rivers. The
      lakes, too, appear to be yearly decreasing in extent, the
      immediate consequence of which is, that the elevated portions
      of the interior are nearly stripped of vegetation, and the
      soil covered with an efflorescence of carbonate of soda,
      there called <i>Tequisquita</i>, resembling very closely the
      plains of the two Castiles, and recalling to the Eastern
      traveller the desolate wastes of some parts of Persia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of elevation on the temperature is most marked,
      and it is no uncommon thing to be shivering on one side of
      the street in the city of Mexico, and to be literally
      scorched by the rays of the sun on the other. Changes are
      upon record of 55&deg; of Fahrenheit within three hours, on
      one of the mountain-plains at the same height with the valley
      of Mexico.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the volcanic character of Mexico, earthquakes
      are by no means so frequent there as in some of the
      neighbouring countries. One of the most memorable on record
      occurred on the 14th of September, 1759, when the volcano of
      Jorullo, with several smaller cones, forced the surface of
      the soil, destroying all before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infinite variety of climate and soil fits this country
      for the production of the fruits of all regions, from those
      of the hottest within the tropics to those of the severest
      cold, where cultivation can be carried on. But the want of
      ports, and of navigable rivers on the Atlantic, opposes the
      advantages that might result from this variety of production,
      though on the Pacific there are a few admirable ports, such
      as Acapulco. The prevalence of the "Nortes," or northerly
      winds, at certain seasons, seriously affects the navigation
      on one side, while that of the "papagallos" is as
      inconvenient on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mexican population is commonly divided into seven
      classes:&mdash;1. European Spaniards, commonly called
      "<i>gachupines</i>." 2. White Creoles. 3. Mestizos,
      descendants of Whites and Indians. 4. Mulattoes, descendants
      of Whites and Blacks. 5. Zambos, from Indians and Negroes. 6.
      Pure Indians. 7. African Blacks. But this classification may
      be reduced to four:&mdash;1. Whites. 2. Indians. 3. Blacks.
      4. Mixed Races, the various gradations of which may be
      considered almost infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians consist of a considerable number of distinct
      tribes, differing in many points of appearance, and
      speaking&mdash;not dialects but&mdash;languages entirely
      different. No less than twenty of these have been traced, and
      of fourteen of them there are already grammars and
      dictionaries. The Indian population is chiefly centered in
      the great plains, and towards the south; and Humboldt thinks
      that it has flowed from the north to the south. The history
      of four great migrations is preserved in the annals of
      Mexico, which are worthy of more detailed examination than we
      can bestow upon them. The great body of these people live
      apart from the other races of their countrymen, in small
      villages, full of ignorance, suspicion, and bigotry, and
      displaying an apparent phlegm, from which it would seem
      impossible to arouse them. This phlegmatic temperament
      lessens the credit of the men with the females, who uniformly
      prefer the European, or the still more vivacious negro. "The
      indigenous Mexican is grave, melancholic, silent, so long as
      he is not under the influence of intoxicating liquors. This
      gravity is peculiarly remarkable in Indian children, who at
      the age of four or five years display more intelligence and
      precocity than the children of whites. The Mexican loves to
      attach mystery even to his most trifling actions; the
      strongest passions do not display themselves in his
      countenance; the transition is frightful when it passes
      suddenly from a state of absolute repose to that of violent
      and unrestrained agitation." Slavery with them has engendered
      guile. They are obstinate in all their habits and opinions;
      their religion is one of mere ceremonial, justifying the
      observation of a priest to Mr. Ward, "son mui buenos
      Catolicos, pero mui malos
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page360" name="page360"></a>[pg
      360]</span> Cristianos" (very good Catholics, but very bad
      Christians.) Deception in this, as well as in every thing
      else, is the order of the day; and the Indian Alcalde now
      oppresses the villagers as much as he himself has ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humboldt considers the Mexican Indian as destitute of all
      imagination, though when to a certain degree educated, he
      attributes to him facility in learning, a clearness of
      understanding, a natural turn for reasoning, and a particular
      aptitude to subtilize and seize trifling distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music and dancing are as dull as might be expected among
      beings so full of phlegm. The Mexican has a turn for painting
      and sculpture; and retains the same fondness for flowers that
      struck Cortez so forcibly upwards of three centuries ago. The
      "Indios Bravos," or Wild Indians, are said to display more
      energy; but our information respecting them is remarkably
      scanty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the active vices of the Mexican Indian, that of
      drunkenness prevails to a most lamentable extent. In the
      upper districts, <i>pulque</i>, or the fermented juice of the
      aloe, is the principal tempter; sometimes a spirit, distilled
      from the same plant, called <i>Vino de Mescal</i>; while, in
      the hotter districts, the same effects are ensured by the
      <i>chinguirito</i>, a very coarse kind of rum. Combined with
      this disposition to intoxication, the Indian is
      constitutionally indolent; and, now that he is a free man, he
      will rarely work, except to obtain just as much as will
      afford him the means of enjoying his greatest
      luxury&mdash;that of steeping his senses in oblivion. This
      last tendency is much to be deplored, as, in the larger
      towns, we know that every Sunday (which is the day of
      greatest indulgence) assassinations, to the extent of six or
      eight each day, are the melancholy consequence of its
      indulgence. Humboldt states that the police were in the
      practice of sending tumbrels round, to collect the unhappy
      victims of intoxication. The punishment was, and we believe
      still is, three days' labour in the streets; but it does not
      seem to be very efficacious, for generally within the week
      the delinquents are again in custody.

    <p>
      There is something characteristic in the indolence of these
      sombre beings. They will travel immense distances; but to
      steady labour they are, generally speaking, not prone. It is
      told of them, that in one of the most fertile districts (the
      <i>Baxio</i>) it is not unusual for an Indian, on receiving
      his wages, to get thoroughly drunk, go to sleep, and on
      awakening renew his potations and repose, until the
      exhaustion of his finances compels him to return to labour.
      In some parts, however, there are exceptions to this
      observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Education has been more attended to, by some of the leading
      personages, than could have been expected in a society that
      had been so much kept in the shade. We apprehend the
      advantages are chiefly prospective, and may be well defined
      in another generation; at present they are but small. The
      whites have been, and still are, the most educated portion of
      the Mexicans, owing, no doubt, to their greater opulence, and
      having access to official rank. The mass of ignorance,
      however, among all classes, is inconceivable to any one who
      has only moved in the principal countries of Europe. Nor is
      it confined to the lower classes, but finds protection among
      the highest in the community. We heard a reverend canon of
      the metropolitan church gravely inquire, whether it was
      possible to reach London except by sailing up the Thames. And
      we knew a very pretty, agreeable young lady, moving in the
      first circles, who could not write a single letter at the age
      of seventeen. She has been since married, and has, we are
      informed, been taught to write by her husband, who is not a
      Mexican. The religion of all classes resembles too much that
      of the Indians; and the practical morality and general tone
      of society are by no means refined. If one half of the
      scandalous tales in circulation be true, the former ranks
      with that of Paris in its worst periods, and the latter is
      assuredly gross to a degree that would surprise even an
      inhabitant of Madrid. The familiarity with which <i>every
      subject</i> is treated at first excites emotions in an
      Englishman of the most unpleasant kind, which gradually
      subside, from the frequency with which they are discussed by
      young and old; by high and low, of both
      sexes.&mdash;<i>Foreign Quarterly Review</i>.

      SIR WALTER SCOTT'S NEW WORK.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We detach this little descriptive gem from Sir Walter Scott's
      "Anne of Geierstein," just published. An outline of this very
      delightful novel will be found in a SUPPLEMENT with the
      present number of the MIRROR.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ancient tower of Geierstein, though neither extensive,
      nor distinguished by architectural ornament, possessed an air
      of terrible dignity by its position on the very verge of the
      opposite bank of the torrent, which, just at the angle of the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page361" name="page361"></a>[pg
      361]</span> rock on which the ruins are situated, falls sheer
      over a cascade of nearly a hundred feet in height, and then
      rushes down the defile, through a trough of living rock,
      which perhaps its waves have been deepening since time itself
      had a commencement. Facing, and at the same time looking down
      upon this eternal roar of waters, stood the old tower, built
      so close to the verge of the precipice, that the buttresses
      with which the architect had strengthened the foundation,
      seemed a part of the solid rock itself, and a continuation of
      its perpendicular ascent. As usual, throughout Europe in the
      feudal times, the principal part of the building was a
      massive square pile, the decayed summit of which was rendered
      picturesque, by flanking turrets of different sizes and
      heights, some round, some angular, some ruinous, some
      tolerably entire, varying the outline of the building as seen
      against the stormy sky."

    <h3>
      THORWALDSEN.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Since the death of his illustrious contemporary, Canova,
      Thorwaldsen, born at Copenhagen in 1771-2, has occupied the
      public eye as head of the modern school. The character and
      powers of this master are doubtless of a very elevated rank:
      but neither in the extent nor excellence of his works, do we
      apprehend his station to be so high as sometimes placed. The
      genius of the Danish sculptor is forcible, yet is its energy
      derived more from peculiarity than from real excellence. His
      ideal springs less from imitation of the antique, or of
      nature, than from the workings of his own individual
      mind&mdash;it is the creation of a fancy seeking forcible
      effect in singular combinations, rather than in general
      principles; therefore hardly fitted to excite lasting or
      beneficial influence upon the age. Simplicity and imposing
      expression seem to have hitherto formed the principal objects
      of his pursuit; but the distinction between the simple and
      rude, the powerful and the exaggerated, is not always
      observed in the labours of the Dane. His simplicity is
      sometimes without grace; the impressive&mdash;austere, and
      without due refinement. The air and contours of his heads,
      except, as in the Mercury&mdash;an excellent example both of
      the beauties and defects of the artist's style&mdash;when
      immediately derived from antiquity, though grand and
      vigorous, seldom harmonize in the principles of these efforts
      with the majestic regularity of general nature. The forms,
      again, are not unfrequently poor, without a vigorous
      rendering of the parts, and destitute at times of their just
      roundness. These defects may in some measure have arisen from
      the early and more frequent practice of the artist in
      relievos. In this department, Thorwaldsen is unexceptionably
      to be admired. The Triumph of Alexander, originally intended
      for the frieze of the government palace at Milan,
      notwithstanding an occasional poverty, in the materials of
      thought, is, as a whole, one of the grandest compositions in
      the world; while the delicacy of execution, and poetic
      feeling, in the two exquisite pieces of Night and Aurora,
      leave scarcely a wish here ungratified. But in statues,
      Thorwaldsen excels only where the forms and sentiment admit
      of uncontrolled imagination, or in which no immediate
      recourse can be had to fixed standards of taste, and to the
      simple effects of nature. Hence, of all his works, as
      admitting of unconfined expression, and grand peculiarity of
      composition, the statues of the Apostles, considered in
      themselves, are the most excellent. Thorwaldsen, in fine,
      possesses singular, but in some respects erratic genius. His
      ideas of composition are irregular; his powers of fancy
      surpass those of execution; his conceptions seem to lose a
      portion of their value and freshness in the act of
      realizement. As an individual artist, he will command
      deservedly a high rank among the names that shall go down to
      posterity. As a sculptor, who will influence, or has extended
      the principles of the art, his pretensions are not great; or,
      should this influence and these claims not be thus limited,
      the standard of genuine and universal excellence must be
      depreciated in a like degree.&mdash;<i>Meme's History of

      father&mdash;prattling thoughtlessly about her
      mother&mdash;every one's admiration for beauty, cleverness,
      and virtue&mdash;gentle as the moon shining on the downs. Her
      name was to be seen written again and again on the sands by
      the Zeeland youths&mdash;and scarcely a beautiful flower
      bloomed but was gathered for her. Now in Zeeland, when the
      south-winds of summer come, there comes too a delicate fish,
      which hides itself in the sand, and which is dug out as a
      luxury by the young people. It is the time of sport and
      gaiety&mdash;and they venture far&mdash;far over the flat
      coast into the sea. The boys drag the girls among the

      ENGLAND AND HER COLONIES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The discouragement of colonization is certainly not the
      feeling of the great majority of the people of England, and
      it is equally certain that it is not the policy of this
      empire. Whatever may be the fate of the several British
      colonies at some future and distant period, it is something
      at least to have spread our laws and language, and moral
      character, over the most distant parts of the globe. The
      colonies that speak the language of Old England&mdash;that
      preserve her manners and her habits&mdash;will always be her
      best customers; and their surplus capital will always centre
      in the mother country. It was not the opinion of our
      ancestors, that colonies were an incumbrance;
      they&mdash;good, stupid souls&mdash;imagined that colonies
      enlarged the sphere of commerce&mdash;-that commerce required
      ships&mdash;that ships created seamen for manning the royal
      navy, and that the whole contributed to individual wealth, to
      the national revenue, and the national strength; and such we
      believe still to be the opinion of men of sound practical
      knowledge, whose minds are unwarped by abstract systems and
      preconceived theories, to which every thing must be made to
      bend. Such, too, was the feeling of that extraordinary man,
      who, with the solitary exception of England, exacted homage
      from every crowned head of Europe. This man, in the plenitude
      of his power, felt that something was still wanting to enable
      him to grapple with one little island, invulnerable by its
      maritime strength, the sinews of which he knew to be derived
      from its colonies: he felt that, deprived as he was of
      "ships, colonies, and commerce," England was able to stand
      alone among nations, and to bid defiance to his overwhelming
      power. That cunning fox, too, by whose councils he was
      occasionally guided, knew too well the degree of strength
      that England derived from her colonies, which he described to
      be her very vitals, and which could only be reached by a
      powerful navy. He designated them as the sheet anchor of
      Great Britain&mdash;the prop that supported her maritime
      superiority&mdash;the strongholds of her power. "Deprive her
      of her colonies," said Talleyrand. "and you break down her
      last wall; you fill up her last ditch."&mdash;<i>Fas est et

      GENEVA
    </h3>
    <p>
      Has very little, as a city, to recommend it. It is
      characterized by much active industry within doors, the
      <i>savans</i> and <i>mechaniciens</i> being pent up in their
      closets and ateliers, and very little gaiety pervades the
      promenades. Some parts of the town are sufficiently
      picturesque; the overhanging roofs, for which it is
      remarkable, are, however, too lofty to screen the pedestrian
      from the rain, especially
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page363" name="page363"></a>[pg
      363]</span> if accompanied by a high wind, and form no shade
      from the sun. The pavement of the streets is bad, and their
      irregularity is a considerable drawback from the internal
      appearance. The pavement of the inclined plane in the Hotel
      de Ville, by which we gain the arduous ascent that conducts
      to the Passport office, is a curiosity of its kind, and
      perhaps unique. The city is tolerably well fenced in with
      walls within walls, draw and suspension bridges, and gates;
      while stakes and chains secure from surprise on the part of
      the lake. The small canton of Geneva, though in the vicinity
      of the Great Alpine chain and the mountains of the Jura,
      includes no mountains. The name of the city and canton has
      been traced by the etymologists to a Celtic origin;
      <i>Gen</i>, a sally-port or exit, and <i>av</i>, a river,
      probably because the Rhone here leaves the Leman lake. The
      eagle on the escutcheon of the city arms indicates its having
      been an <i>imperial</i> city; and it is believed the key was
      an adjunct of Pope Martin V., in the year 1418. The motto on
      the scroll, "Ex tenebris lux," appears to have existed
      anterior to the <i>light</i> of the Reformation. The number
      of inhabitants may now be estimated at about 22,000; but it
      appears, by a census in 1789, to have been 26,148. In this
      moral city, it is computed that every twelfth birth is
      illegitimate. The number of people engaged in clock and
      watch-making and jewellery, may be safely rated at 3,000. In
      years favourable to these staple manufactures 75,000 ounces
      of gold are employed, which is almost equally divided between
      watches and jewellery. The daily supply of silver is about
      134 ounces. Pearls form an article of considerable value in
      the jewellery, and have been rated at no less a sum that
      1,200 francs daily. 70,000 watches are annually made, only
      one-twelfth of which are in silver. More than fifty distinct
      branches are comprised in the various departments, and each
      workman, on the average, earns about three shillings

      his epistle looks like the floor of a garden-house, covered
      with old, crooked nails, which have just been released from a
      century's durance in a brick wall. I cannot cast my eyes on
      his character without being religious. This is the only good
      effect I have derived from his writings; he brings into my
      mind the resurrection, and paints the tumultuous
      resuscitation of awakened men with a pencil of masterly
      confusion. I am fully convinced of one thing, either that he
      or his pen is intoxicated when he writes to me, for his
      letters seem to have borrowed the reel of wine, and stagger
      from one corner of the sheet to the other. They remind me of

      following statement of the efficacy of the guaco for the cure
      of the bite of a mad dog, published by the gentleman who
      first made use of the plant in South America, as an antidote
      to that scourge of human nature, hydrophobia; his words are,
      "I shall simply state, that during my residence in South
      America, I had frequent opportunities of witnessing the
      direful effects of hydrophobia, without having in any one
      case that came under my care been successful in its cure by
      the usual modes prescribed in Europe. It fortunately occurred
      to me, that the guaco, so celebrated for curing the bite or
      sting of all venomous snakes, might prove equally efficacious
      in hydrophobic cases. How far my idea was correct that an
      analogy existed between the virus of a serpent and that of a
      rabid dog, I leave to others to determine; but such was my
      opinion, and I acted upon it in all subsequent cases with
      complete success."

      We understand the same gentleman has received from South
      America two plants which he was in the habit of prescribing
      for insanity and pulmonary consumption, with the happiest
      effects; and as it is his intention to give them an immediate
      trial, should they be found to answer in Europe, as in South
      America, of which he has not the least doubt, the discovery
      may be considered as of the first consequence in medicine.

    <p>
      The <i>Journal Des Reconnaissances Useless</i> gives the
      following method of curing legs of mutton like ham:&mdash;It
      is necessary that the mutton should be very fat. Two ounces
      of raw sugar must be mixed with an ounce of common salt and
      half a spoonful of saltpetre. The meat is to be rubbed well
      with this, and then placed in a tureen. It must be beaten and
      turned twice a day during three consecutive days; and the
      scum which comes from the meat having been taken off, it is
      to be wiped, and again rubbed with the mixture. The next day
      it should be again beaten, and the two operations ought to be
      repeated alternately during ten days, care being taken to
      turn the meat each time. It must be then exposed to the smoke
      for ten days. These hams are generally eaten cold.

    <p>
      A mode has been adopted to prepare potatoes as food, which
      has at least one advantage&mdash;that of economy. The
      potatoes are roasted in a kiln or oven, and are thus
      prevented from sprouting, (which injures their quality so
      much at this season of the year,) and are thus preserved for
      some time in a fit state for consumption. They are better for
      being again heated before they are used, and though it is to
      be regretted that persons should be reduced to such food, yet
      they are cheaper and more wholesome than the bread usually
      given in times of scarcity to the poorer classes.

      A correspondent of the <i>Gardener's Magazine</i> states,

      succeeded by spreading some well cut chaff round the plants
      under hand glasses, and some round the outsides of the
      glasses. The slugs in their attempt to reach the plant, find
      themselves immediately enveloped in the chaff, which prevents
      their moving, so that when he raised the glasses to give the
      plants air, he found hundreds of disabled slugs round the
      outside of the glasses, which he took away and destroyed.

      When peas, French beans, &amp;c. do not boil easily, it has
      usually been imputed to the coolness of the season, or to the
      rains. This popular notion is erroneous. The difficulty of
      boiling them soft arises from an excess of gypsum imbibed
      during their growth. To correct this, throw a small quantity
      of subcarbonate of soda into the pot along with the

      <i>Electricity</i>.

    <p>
      It is curious to take a retrospective view of the mode in
      which the effects of the Leyden phial were announced to the
      world, on their first discovery. The philosophers who first
      experienced, in their own person, the shock attendant on the
      transmission of an electric discharge, were so impressed with
      wonder and with terror by this novel sensation, that they
      wrote the most ridiculous and exaggerated account of their
      feelings on the occasion. Muschenbrok states, that he
      received so dreadful a concussion in his arms, shoulder, and
      heart, that he lost his breath, and it was two days before he
      could recover from its effects; he declared also, that he
      should not be induced to take another shock for the whole
      kingdom of France. Mr. Allemand reports, that the shock
      deprived him of breath for some minutes, and afterwards
      produced so acute a pain along his right arm, that he was
      apprehensive it might be attended with serious consequences.
      Mr. Winkler informs us, that it threw his whole body into
      convulsions, and excited such a ferment in his blood, as
      would have thrown him into a fever, but for the timely
      employment of febrifuge remedies. He states, that at another
      time it produced copious bleeding at the nose; the same
      effect was produced also upon his lady, who was almost
      rendered incapable of walking. The strange accounts naturally
      excite the attention and wonder of all classes of people; the
      learned and the vulgar were equally desirous of experiencing
      so singular a sensation, and great numbers of half-taught
      electricians wandered through every part of Europe to gratify
      this universal curiosity.
    </p>

      It is on the nervous system that the most considerable action
      of electricity is exerted. A strong charge passed through the
      head, gave to Mr. Singer the sensation of a violent but
      universal blow, and was followed by a transient loss of
      memory and indistinctness of vision. If a charge be sent
      through the head of a bird, its optic nerve is usually
      injured or destroyed, and permanent blindness induced; and a
      similar shock given to larger animals, produces a tremulous
      state of the muscles, with general prostration of strength.
      If a person who is standing receive a charge through the
      spine, he loses his power over the muscles to such a degree,
      that he either drops on his knees, or falls prostrate on the
      ground; if the charge be sufficiently powerful, it will
      produce immediate death, in consequence, probably, of the
      sudden exhaustion of the whole energy of the nervous system.
      Small animals, such as mice and sparrows, are instantly
      killed by a shock from thirty square inches of glass. Van
      Marum found that eels are irrecoverably deprived of life when
      a shock is sent through their whole body; but when only a
      part of the body is included in the circuit, the destruction
      of irritability is confined to that individual part, while
      the rest retains the power of motion. Different persons are
      affected in very different degrees by electricity, according
      to their peculiar constitutional susceptibility. Dr. Young
      remarks, that a very minute tremor, communicated to the most
      elastic parts of the body, in particular the chest, produces
      an agitation of the nerves, which is not wholly unlike the
      effect of a weak electricity.

      rapidly undergo putrefaction, and the action of electricity
      upon the flesh of animals is also found to accelerate this
      process in a remarkable degree. The same effect has been
      observed in the bodies of persons destroyed by lightning. It
      is also a well-established fact, that the blood does not
      coagulate after death from this cause.

      A cheap and powerful freezing mixture may be made by
      pulverizing Glauber's salts finely, and placing it level at
      the bottom of a glass vessel. Equal parts of sal ammoniac and
      nitre are then to be finely powdered, and mixed together, and
      subsequently added to the Glauber's salts, stirring the
      powders well together; after which adding water sufficient to
      dissolve the salts, a degree of cold will be produced,
      frequently below Zero of Fahrenheit. But Mr. Walker states,
      that nitrate of ammonia, phosphate of soda, and diluted
      nitric acid, will on the instant produce a reduction of
      temperature amounting to 80 degrees. It is desirable to
      reduce the temperature of the substances previously, if
      convenient, by placing the vessels in water, with nitre
      powder thrown in occasionally.

      <i>Microscopic Examination of the Blood</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      By the aid of Tulley's achromatic microscope, and under
      highly magnifying powers, it has recently been discovered
      that the globules of the blood congeal into flat circular
      bodies, and arrange themselves in rows, one body being placed
      partly underneath another, and in like manner as a pile of
      similar coins, when thrown gently down, would be found to
      arrange themselves. This curious effect has been attributed
      to the vitality yet remaining in the blood, during the act of
      congealing. At any rate it is a most singular fact, for
      although we might naturally conceive that the flattened
      circular plates would place themselves in juxtaposition, yet
      we never could have supposed that they would have partly
      slipped underneath each other. In order to make this very
      curious experiment, it is necessary that the blood, as
      freshly drawn, be slightly and thinly smeared over the
      surface of a slip of crown, or window glass, and be covered
      with a very thin slip of Bohemian plate glass; and thus some
      slight inequalities in the thickness of the layer of blood
      between them will be produced, and which are necessary to
      succeed in producing the very curious appearances
      abovementioned.&mdash;<i>Gilt's Repository</i>.

      ounces of river water. When the sugar is dissolved, add a
      sufficient quantity of the above infusion of orange peels, to
      give it a predominant flavour; and aromatise with 3 grammes
      of fine cinnamon, and as much mace, both well bruised.
      Lastly, throw into the liqueur 31 grammes (1 ounce) of Brazil
      wood, in powder. Leave the whole in infusion ten days, being
      stirred three or four times a day. At the end of this time
      taste the liqueur; and if it be too strong and sweet, add
      more water to it; if too weak, add alcohol, at 30 degrees;
      and if it be not sweet enough, put syrup to it. Give it

      A mixture of two parts Danube sand, and one part common
      earth, was laid in a layer an inch thick, in one corner of my
      cellar; and, in April, thirty-two yellow potatoes with their
      skins placed upon its surface. They threw out stalks on all
      sides; and, at the end of the following November, more than a
      quarter of a bushel of the best potatoes were gathered, about
      a tenth part of which were about the size of apples&mdash;the
      rest as large as nuts. The skin was very thin; the pulp
      farinaceous, white, and of a good taste. No attention was
      given to the potatoes during the time they remained on the
      sand, and they grew without the influence of the sun or
      light. This trial may be advantageously applied in fortified
      places, hospitals, houses of correction, and, in general, in
      all places where cellars or subterraneous places occur, being
      neither too cold nor too moist; and where it is important to
      procure a cheap, but abundant nourishment for many
      individuals.&mdash;<i>From the French</i>.

      Woolsthorp, Lincolnshire, a little village on the great north

      The house in which he was born, is a kind of farmhouse, built

      Stukely visited it in 1721, and was showed the inside of it
      by the country people; in a letter to Dr. Mead on this
      occasion, he says, "They led me up stairs, and showed me Sir
      Isaac's study, where I suppose he studied when in the
      country, in his younger days, as perhaps, when he visited his
      mother from the university. I observed the shelves were of

      When Lord Norbury was applied to by a collector of one of the
      local taxes for the amount of tax, his lordship said, he had
      already paid it, and on looking to his file, discovered a
      receipt, signed by the same collector who then applied for
      it. The tax-man, confounded, apologized in the best manner he
      could, stating his regret that he did not recollect it. "I
      dare say," said my lord, "you are very sorry you did not
      <i>re</i>-collect it."

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
